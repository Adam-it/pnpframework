### Best practices when contributing

- This is all new and we're here to help, don't hesitate to reach out with your questions and feedback via [our issue list](https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework/issues)
- To avoid overlapping efforts in the startup phase please let us know if you plan to take on a particular chunk of work (e.g. let's say you want to extend the model to support Planner)
- If you are extending the model and you need to update the model base logic then please reach out, we want to align and agree on those changes first as these need to fit into our model approach
